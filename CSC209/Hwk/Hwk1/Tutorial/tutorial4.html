<p>Sally yelled <em><q>I lost my wallet!</q></em></p>

<p>According to Chase Bank here is what you need to do:</p>
<blockquote style="border:dashed;background-color:aliceblue;" cite="https://www.chase.com/personal/banking/education/basics/lost-wallet">
First, try to recall where you last had your wallet. Retrace your steps, check your recent activities and search in likely places: your home, car or the last store you visited. Sometimes, a very thorough search with a cool head will help you find what's lost. However, if you truly think you've lost your wallet, start gathering information about its contents.
